	* generic/tclOO.c (NextObjCmd): Make this behave consistently with
	documentation and what is most useful in practice.

	* generic/tclOO.c (TclOOObjectName, SelfObjCmd, ObjectRenamedTrace):
	Added code to manage a cache of the command name for the [self object]
	command. It seems that this was previously a very slow command. In so
	doing, allow simplification of a lot of code.

2007-06-06  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* Makefile.in (shell): Added target for convenience of interactive
	testing.

	* Makefile.in (benchmarks): Added some benchmarking scripts, based off
	* benchmarks/*.tcl:	    those in http://dada.perl.it/shootout/

	* doc/next.n: Substantial enhancements, including a demonstration of
	how a mixin and a filter can build a simple bolt-on method result
	memoization cache.

2007-06-05  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* Makefile.in: Added targets for building docs and distributions and
	installing documentation.

2007-06-04  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/ooInfo.n: Added documentation for the introspection commands.

2007-06-03  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/Method.3: The other half of the C interface, being the part
	dealing with methods.

2007-06-02  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/Class.3: Started documenting the C interface.

2007-06-01  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/next.n: Added documentation for [next].
	* doc/my.n: Added documentation for [my].

2007-05-31  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/self.n: Added some documentation for [self].

	* generic/tclOO.c (InvokeForwardMethod, ObjectUnknown): Better fix
	for the unknown method handling.
	* doc/object.n: Document it correctly.

2007-05-30  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/copy.n: Started work on documenting oo::copy.

	* generic/tclOO.c (ObjectUnknown): Fixed possible crash when unknown
	method used directly.

	* configure.in: Detect sdx during configure time, not make time.

2007-05-29  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* TclOO.rc, Makefile.in, configure.in: Horrific hacking to make the
	generated DLL have nice metadata on Windows.

	* doc/class.n: Started work on third documentation file.
	* doc/object.n: Started work on second documentation file.

2007-05-28  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/define.n: Completed the list of define subcommands, but not yet
	documented what they all do. Added basic example.

2007-05-24  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* license.terms: Added, same license as Tcl/Tk.
	* doc/define.n: Started to write documentation.

2007-05-19  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* Makefile.in (kit): Rewrote to make the building of a starkit work
	for myself. Also tried to separate out things substituted by configure
	from things that are not substituted. The build now _requires_ GNU
	make to work, since it is easier to control substitution with it.

2007-05-18  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* Makefile.in (kit): Added _experimental_ code to build a starkit
	distribution of the code.
	* configure.in (PLATFORM): Added code to determine what platform we
	are building for, needed for making the build of the kit work right.

	* Makefile.in (pkgIndex.tcl): Update the statement of what version

	* tests/oo.test: Convert {expand} to {*}.
	* generic/tclOOInt.h, generic/tclOO.h: Remove obsolete comments.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Updated to latest TEA and corrected build
	system to work on more platforms.
	* pkgIndex.tcl (removed): This file now generated automatically.

	* generic/tclOO.c (Tcloo_Init, ObjectDeletedTrace)
	(Tcl_CopyObjectInstance, ObjectCmd): Remove unused variables.

	Initial check-in as an extension.
