.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A method is an operation carried out on an object that is associated with the
object. Every method must be attached to either an object or a class; methods
attached to a class are associated with all instances (direct and indirect) of
that class.
.PP
Given a method, the entity that declared it can be found using
\fBTcl_MethodDeclarerClass\fR which returns the class that the method is
attached to (or NULL if the method is not attached to any class) and
\fBTcl_MethodDeclarerObject\fR which returns the object that the method is
attached to (or NULL if the method is not attached to an object). The name of
the method can be retrieved with \fBTcl_MethodName\fR and whether the method
is exported is retrieved with \fBTcl_MethodIsPublic\fR. The type of the method
can also be introspected upon to a limited degree; the function
\fBTcl_MethodIsType\fR returns whether a method is of a particular type,
assigning the per-method \fIclientData\fR to the variable pointed to by
\fIclientDataPtr\fR if (that is non-NULL) if the type is matched.
.SS "METHOD CREATION"
.PP
Methods are created by \fBTcl_NewMethod\fR and \fBTcl_NewClassMethod\fR, which
create a method attached to an object or a class respectively. In both cases,
the \fInameObj\fR argument gives the name of the method to create, the
\fIisPublic\fR argument states whether the method should be exported
initially, the \fImethodTypePtr\fR argument describes the implementation of
the method (see the \fBMETHOD TYPES\fR section below) and the \fIclientData\fR
argument gives some implementation-specific data that is passed on to the
implementation of the method when it is called.
.PP
Note that when the \fInameObj\fR argument is NULL an unmanaged method is
created (used internally for constructors and destructors). The memory
management of methods is non-trivial, and so client code should not create
unmanaged methods at the moment. Similarly, a NULL \fImethodTypePtr\fR is used
to provide internal signalling, and should not be used in client code.
.SS "METHOD CALL CONTEXTS"
.PP
When a method is called, a method-call context reference is passed in as one
of the arguments to the implementation function. This context can be inspected
to provide information about the caller, but should not be retained beyond the
moment when the method call terminates.
.PP
The method that is being called can be retrieved from the context by using
\fBTcl_ObjectContextMethod\fR, and the object that caused the method to be
invoked can be retrieved with \fBTcl_ObjectContextObject\fR. The number of
arguments that are to be skipped (e.g. the object name and method name in a
normal method call) is read with \fBTcl_ObjectContextSkippedArgs\fR, and the
context can also report whether it is working as a filter for another method
through \fBTcl_ObjectContextIsFiltering\fR.
.SH "METHOD TYPES"
.PP
The types of methods are described by a pointer to a Tcl_MethodType structure,
which is defined as:
.CS
typedef struct {
    int \fIversion\fR;
    const char *\fIname\fR;
    Tcl_MethodCallProc \fIcallProc\fR;
    Tcl_MethodDeleteProc \fIdeleteProc\fR;
    Tcl_MethodCloneProc \fIcloneProc\fR;
} Tcl_MethodType;
.CE
The \fIversion\fR field allows for future expansion of the structure, and
should always be declared equal to TCL_OO_METHOD_VERSION_CURRENT. The
\fIname\fR field provides a human-readable name for the type, and is reserved
for debugging.
.PP
The \fIcallProc\fR field gives a function that is called when the method is
invoked; it must never be NULL. The type signature of the \fIcallProc\fR field
is:
.CS
typedef int (*Tcl_MethodCallProc) (ClientData \fIclientData\fR, Tcl_Interp *\fIinterp\fR,
	Tcl_ObjectContext \fIobjectContext\fR, int \fIobjc\fR, Tcl_Obj *const *\fIobjv\fR);
.CE
The \fIclientData\fR argument to a Tcl_MethodCallProc is the value that was
given when the method was created, the \fIinterp\fR is a place in which to
execute scripts and access variables as well as being where to put the result
of the method, and the \fIobjc\fR and \fIobjv\fR fields give the parameter
objects to the method. The calling context of the method can be discovered
through the \fIobjectContext\fR argument, and the return value from a
Tcl_MethodCallProc is any Tcl return code (e.g. TCL_OK, TCL_ERROR).
.PP
The \fIdeleteProc\fR field gives a function that is used to delete a
particular method, and is called when the method is replaced or removed; if
the field is NULL, it is assumed that the method's \fIclientData\fR needs no
special action to delete. The type signature of the \fIdeleteProc\fR field is:
.CS
typedef void (*Tcl_MethodDeleteProc) (ClientData \fIclientData\fR);
.CE
The \fIclientData\fR argument to a Tcl_MethodDeleteProc will be the same as
the value passed to the \fIclientData\fR argument to \fBTcl_NewMethod\fR or
\fBTcl_NewClassMethod\fR when the method was created.
.PP
The \fIcloneProc\fR field is either a function that is used to copy a method's
\fIclientData\fR (as part of \fBTcl_CopyObjectInstance\fR) or NULL to indicate
that the \fIclientData\fR can just be copied directly. The type signature of
the \fIcloneProc\fR field is:
.CS
typedef int (*Tcl_MethodCloneProc)(ClientData \fIoldClientData\fR,
        ClientData *\fInewClientData\fR);
.CE
The \fIoldClientData\fR field to a Tcl_MethodCloneProc gives the value from
the method being copied from, and the \fInewClientData\fR field will point to
a variable in which to write the value for the method being copied to. The
function should return TCL_OK and write into \fInewClientData\fR if the method
is to be copied, and return TCL_ERROR otherwise (when the method will be
silently not copied).
