\fBoo::define\fI classOrObject subcommand arg\fR ?\fIarg ...\fR?

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBoo::define\fR command is used to control the configuration of classes
and objects, with the configuration being applied to the entity named in the
\fIclassOrObject\fR argument. Configuring a class also updates the
configuration of all subclasses of the class and all objects that are
instances of that class or which mix it in (as modified by any per-instance
configuration). The way in which the configuration is done is controlled by
either the \fIdefScript\fR argument or by the \fIsubcommand\fR and following
\fIarg\fR arguments; when the second is present, it is exactly as if all the
arguments from \fIsubcommand\fR onwards are made into a list and that list is
used as the \fIdefScript\fR argument.
.PP
The following commands are supported in the \fIdefScript\fR, each of which may
also be used in the \fIsubcommand\fR form:
.TP
\fBconstructor\fI argList bodyScript\fR
.
This creates or updates the constructor for a class. The formal arguments to
the constructor (defined using the same format as for the Tcl \fBproc\fR
command) will be \fIargList\fR, and the body of the constructor will be
\fIbodyScript\fR. When the body of the constructor is evaluated, the current
namespace of the constructor will be a namespace that is unique to the object
being constructed. Within the constructor, the \fBnext\fR command should be
used to call the superclasses' constructors. If \fIbodyScript\fR is the empty
string, the constructor will be deleted.
.TP
\fBdestructor\fI bodyScript\fR
.
This creates or updates the destructor for a class. Destructors take no
arguments, and the body of the destructor will be \fIbodyScript\fR. The
destructor is called when objects of the class are deleted, and when called
will have the object's unique namespace as the current namespace. Destructors
should use the \fBnext\fR command to call the superclasses' destructors. Note
that destructors are not called in all situations (e.g. if the interpreter is
destroyed). If \fIbodyScript\fR is the empty string, the destructor will be
deleted.
.TP
\fBexport\fI name \fR?\fIname ...\fR?
.
.I TODO
.TP
\fBfilter\fR ?\fImethodName ...\fR?
.
When defining a class, this sets or updates the list of method names that are
used to guard whether a method call to instances of the class may be called
and what the method's results are, and when defining another kind of object,
this sets or updates the list of method names that are used to guard whether a
method call to the object may be called and what the method's results are.
Each \fImethodName\fR names a single filtering method (which may be exposed or
not exposed); it is not an error for a non-existent method to be named since
they may be defined by subclasses. If no \fImethodName\fR arguments are
present, the list of filter names is set to empty.
.TP
\fBforward\fI name cmdName \fR?\fIarg ...\fR?
.
When defining a class, this creates or updates a class method, and when
defining another kind of object, this creates or updates an object method. The
name of the method is \fIname\fR. The method is defined be forwarded to the
command called \fIcmdName\fR, with additional arguments, \fIarg\fR etc., added
before those arguments specified by the caller of the method. Forwarded
methods should be deleted using the \fBmethod\fR subcommand.
.TP
\fBmethod\fI name argList bodyScript\fR
.
When defining a class, this creates or updates a class method, and when
defining another kind of object, this creates or updates an object method. The
name of the method is \fIname\fR, the formal arguments to the method (defined
using the same format as for the Tcl \fBproc\fR command) will be
\fIargList\fR, and the body of the method will be \fIbodyScript\fR. When the
body of the method is evaluated, the current namespace of the method will be a
namespace that is unique to the current object. If \fIbodyScript\fR is the
empty string, the method will be deleted.
.TP
.\fBmixin\fR ?\fIclassName ...\fR?
.
When defining a class, this sets or updates the list of additional classes
that are to be mixed into all the instances of the class, and when defining
another kind of object, this sets or updates a per-object list of additional
classes that are to be mixed into the object. Each argument, \fIclassName\fR,
names a single class that is to be mixed in; if no classes are present, the
list of mixed-in classes is set to be empty.
.TP
.\fBself.class\fI className\fR
.
This allows the class of an object to be changed after creation. Note that the
class's constructors are not called when this is done, and so the object may
well be in an inconsistent state unless additional configuration work is done.
.TP
\fBsuperclass\fI className \fR?\fIclassName ...\fR?
.
This allows the alteration of the superclasses of the class being defined.
Each \fIclassName\fR argument names one class that is to be a superclass of
the defined class. Note that objects must not be changed from being classes to
being non-classes or vice-versa.
.TP
\fBunexport\fI name \fR?\fIname ...\fR?
.
.I TODO
.SS "TREATING CLASSES AS OBJECTS"
Since classes are themselves objects, manipulating them as such is done
through this command. In order to force the \fBdefine\fR subcommands to work
with the object when presented with a class, they should have their names
prefixed with \fBself.\fR, thus \fBself.method\fR vs. \fBmethod\fR.
.PP
The following commands may be prefixed this way:
.DS
.ta 6c
\fBexport\fR	\fBmethod\fR
\fBfilter\fR	\fBmixin\fR
\fBforward\fR	\fBunexport\fR
